# Genki Study Resources
Genki Study Resources is a website that offers a vast collection of exercises for practicing what is taught in [Genki: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese](http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/index_en). It was mainly created to help aid with self-study, as such, you can use it online or offline depending on your needs. Choose one of the links below to begin testing the Japanese you've learned in Genki!


**Online Version :** https://sethclydesdale.github.io/genki-study-resources/

**Offline Version :** [download](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/genki-study-resources/archive/master.zip)


### Using the Offline Version
If you're using the offline version you'll have to unzip the files. Once you've done that, you can access all the study resources by opening any of the [**index.html**](https://i62.servimg.com/u/f62/18/21/41/30/captur11.png) files in the browser of your choice. It should have the same experience as the online version, however, whenever new exercises/lessons are added they wont be available; you'll have to download the latest version of the repository to get them.


### Notice
This is currently a work in progress. I will be expanding it as I continue studying the Genki textbooks. The reason I created this is mostly so I can setup exercises for myself to practice, however, you are free to use everything here as well. The self-study resources Genki provided are helpful, but not complete, as such I plan to work on exercises for all lessons, including practice and workbook problems.
