        <p>When using Genki Study Resources offline, sometimes you may run into an issue where exercises will endlessly load. This is usually related to the blocking of third-party cookies, which for whatever reason, blocks cookies and localStorage of locally used files giving you the following result.</p>
        
        <div class="center"><a href="../../resources/images/general/stuck-loading.png" target="_blank"><img src="../../resources/images/general/stuck-loading.png" alt="endless loading"></a></div>
        
        <p>Thankfully this can easily be fixed by adjusting some settings in your browser, unless of course you're using Mircosoft Edge, which you shouldn't, because that has a bug (or super-paranoid security) that doesn't let local files function at all even when all cookies are allowed.</p>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3 class="section-title" id="adjusting-settings">Adjusting Browser Settings</h3>
        <p>To fix this issue, simply go to settings in your browser and search for <strong>cookie</strong> related settings, and look for an option that says "Block third-party cookies" or "Only block cross-site cookies" and either change it to "Allow all" or turn it off. This is a common issue with Chromium-based browsers, so it should be easy to fix by following <a href="https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/bug-reporting-guidelines/uncaught-securityerror-failed-to-read-the-localstorage-property-from-window-access-is-denied-for-this-document" target="_blank">this guide</a>, but regardless, I'll list individual browser instructions for affected browsers below.</p>
        
        <h4 id="settings-chrome">Google Chrome and Opera</h4>
        <p>Go to <strong>Settings > Privacy and security > Site Settings > Cookies and site data</strong> and turn <strong>Block third-party cookies</strong> off.</p>
        
        <h4 id="settings-chrome">Brave</h4>
        <p>Go to <strong>Settings > Shields > Cookies</strong> and set it to <strong>Allow all cookies</strong>.</p>
        
        <h4 id="settings-chrome">Microsoft Edge</h4>
        <p>Download either <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a>, <a href="https://www.opera.com/" target="_blank">Opera</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>.</p>
